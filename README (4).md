During Sprint 4

I demonstrated a strong grasp of API functionality by successfully designing and executing comprehensive test cases. I showed proficiency in using documentation tools such as ApiDoc and Swagger to create well-structured test cases that consistently included all essential elements: titles, test steps, request bodies, expected and actual results, and test status. I effectively implemented both positive and negative test scenarios, along with boundary value tests, to ensure robust API validation. A key learning was recognizing the importance of testing parameters individually to better isolate and understand failures. Additionally, I documented all failed test cases thoroughly, including clear reproduction steps, relevant data, and environment details. These efforts resulted in detailed and actionable bug reports. This sprint allowed me to further develop my skills in API testing, edge case analysis, and technical documentation, laying a solid foundation for even more effective testing in future projects.
